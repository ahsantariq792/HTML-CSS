        <p><h4 class="faq-h4">Meeting a buyer</h4>

            Always meet in person. We'd recommend trading locally for safe deals.
            A buyer who offers you more money to ship your item to them is usually a scammer, and you can report them.
            Try to meet in a public place like a shopping mall or petrol station. If someone needs to come to your house to fetch a large item, make sure you have a friend or family member with you. <br><br>
            <h4 class="faq-h4">Making the exchange</h4>
            
            As far as possible, only get paid in cash for your item
            If you must accept a bank transfer, make sure you call your bank to check that the funds have cleared before handing over the item
            Never accept proof of payment SMS or email - these are very easy to fake.
            We aren’t in any position to handle or facilitate any exchange of money. So, please, be careful when handing overpayment.
            <h2 class="faq-h2">How do I buy safely?</h2>
            <h4 class="faq-h4">If you’re buying</h4>

            This might seem simple, but it can’t be said enough - always<br>

            1. Meet the seller in person in a public place, like at a mall, etc.<br>
            2. Only hand over the money once you’re happy with what you’re buying<br>
            3. Whatever you do, don’t buy before you try - always examine the item and then pay for it
            And please, be careful
